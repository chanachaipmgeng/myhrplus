/* Component uses Tailwind classes directly in HTML */
/* All glass morphism, hover effects, and animations handled by Tailwind utilities */
/* Dark mode and Myhr theme handled via Tailwind dark: and theme-myhr: variants */
/* Animation classes are now handled by utility classes from _mixins.scss (fade-in, fade-in-up, fade-in-down, scale-in) */
